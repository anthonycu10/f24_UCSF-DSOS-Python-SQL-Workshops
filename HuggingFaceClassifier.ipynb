              "\"we're on record jonathan chubb representing morons rosina and zito jennifer breckenridge from huygens and berman i represent the state of washington in the washington attorney general action timothy butler the farmer hellerman wide makalah seattle washington representing philip morris in the washington attorney general's action jeff while protective pricing roads representing the toolbars defendants in the case formerly known as arch now known as bonds ship nunnelly and charles griffith with honey williams representing philip morris in both the washington and the and the pristina matters and for purposes of the deposition dr. lilly gordon dr. willy my name is more jonathan schell i represent the plaintiffs in the case of certified as a class action known as barnes at alverson is a united states back oh i doubt i'm going to be asking you some questions this morning about some of your activities and work that you've done or are doing right now philip morris i know that you've been down this road before deposition so you have some familiarity with the process it all right i want to tell you though that i'm going to assume surf that if you answer a question that i've asked you and you have understood that question if you don't understand the question please by all means ask me to rephrase it or if you didn't hear it ask me to repeat it because i want to make sure that you know we're sort of on the same wavelength is that clear that's claire yes you need to take just one thing about the introduction you mention that he's been down the path before just so the jury knows he's only been down at once so he's not at a school door professional witness he's been deposed once before okay thank you jeff if you need to take a break in any time certainly let your counselor or me know and we'll accommodate you that clear yes i can you realize you're under oath that correctly and has the same force or effect as if you are testifying in court and just for the record if you would say yes so she can go inside yes sorry yes or no that was the next reminder yes or knows do a lot better for her and taking an asian range the videographer obviously can pick it up but the court reporter cans well i appreciate that very much it's dr. lilly you're currently employed by philip morris is that correct that's correct and your employer richmond i'm employed in richmond yes and and your position is principal scientist is that correct well my position today is vice president of technology assessment as of less than a year ago so you would say you were promoted to that position in 1986 and 1996 august/september yes who reported to his vp of technology assessment now i report to dr. kathy alice who's senior vice president of research and development the chain of command a tardy and i assume you are default more is that correct that's correct are you considered to be second in command to kathy ellis objections to form reporting to dr. ellis are several people none of which in my mind are second in command there's a vice president of process technology a vice president of product technology a vice president of planning and business systems a vice president of research myself who's called vice president of technology assessment and i'm a director or group director i may say of was he call himself it's dr. carr churchman i think he calls himself science and technology excuse me that might stir done things recent objection reminds me one housekeeping matter we got to put on the record can we have the usual agreement john that an objection by one council has adopted by all and thereby avoiding the me to type of sections so it would thank you who's a vice president process technology right now the vice president of process technology is harold burnley who's vice president of product technology vice president product technology is ron lively level1 that's correct who's vice president for planning business systems just recently and you're talking about maybe three weeks jimmy merical nyira who is in that position before people i had the planning group before jim came back and he was vice president of q&a and he returned to our nd then the planning part went to him who's vice president for research pardon vice president research is richard cox and vice president for technology assessment that's you have that aren't met yeah who is in that position before you i've i think i've been in the position you know for ever since it was formed what do you currently do as vice president for technology assessment objections to form we rephrase that what are your responsibilities as vice president for technology assessment my responsibilities are largely to search out and lead development efforts for technology the company may need five to years from now when you say technologies the company may need 5 to 10 years from now are you talking about the technology the area of cigarette manufacturing design some things there but basically new control systems for manufacturing sensors to do realtime measurements some of the non conventional products that the company has researched actually things that also might be valuable for p. m. companies in general general food our craft and the miller beer paper how much of your time would you say dr. lily right now is devoted to products in the cigarette area very little of my time presently is devoted to the cigarette area you'd say that's the 10% of your time yes and when did that strike that has that percentage of time spent changed over the years that you've been in philip morris well i think early on in my career i did a lot of work with combustion and pyrolysis and early on filtration i then have been in mostly new technology for processing and i've done a lot of work in non conventional cigarette products as opposed to the conventional ones that are normally being so i won't interrupt your question but just for the record we've been joined by alpha mcdonald he's with the law firm of arnold & porter and he is counsel to philip morris another matter depending on where the examination goes we may get into areas that are deemed competitively sensitive to philip morris \""
