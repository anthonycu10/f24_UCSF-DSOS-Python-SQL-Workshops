# 2024-UCSF-DSOS-Python-SQL-Fall-Workshops

Code and Data for the 2024 Fall Python/SQL fall workshop series at the UCSF Library

## Intro to Python and SQL, Part 1 (10/4/24)

In this workshop, we produced two notebooks

### Python_SQL_Day_1.ipynb

We created this notebook using Google Colab, but it should work if you open it with Jupyter Notebook on your laptop or workstation. This notebook contains to read a CSV file containing Covid testing data from Carbon Health into a pandas dataframe. 

For more information on this data set, see: https://covidclinicaldata.org


### Oregon-Sugar-Document

We create this document using Jupyter Notebook running locally. This notebook demonstrates how to load text data in a tab-delimited format into a pandas dataframe. We downloaded the "Oregon Sugar Document" from the UCSF Industry Documents Library. This dataset contains prepared dataset text extracted through OCR from scanned image and pdf files. You may notice that some documents are more accurately transcribed than others, and some documents have a large amount of non-alphanumerical characters that result from attempts to transcribe images, handwriting, or other difficult-to-translate artifacts of a document. Note that this document was produced a few years ago, and more recent (though also more expensive) transcription technologies are now able to transcribe handwriting, cursive, and text within images much more accurately.
